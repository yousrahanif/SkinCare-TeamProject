Part 1 - Project Topic

Abstract:
Our project aims to change the way people take care of their skin by introducing a user-friendly skincare platform. In the world of personal hygiene and health, skincare is crucial, but many struggle due to too many products and not enough trustworthy guidance. Our platform addresses this issue by providing easy-to-understand and up-to-date information on skincare products and routines.
The main goal of our platform is to empower users to manage their skincare effectively. We offer a carefully curated database of skincare products, including detailed info on ingredients, effectiveness, and user reviews. Additionally, we provide expert-written articles and guides on skincare routines for various concerns, helping users make informed choices based on their specific needs.
We value inclusivity and cater to diverse skin types and concerns. Our platform encourages a community where users can share their experiences, insights, and recommendations. By creating a supportive space, we aim to make skincare less confusing and more enjoyable for everyone.
The success of our platform depends on giving users the knowledge to make informed skin care decisions. Ultimately, we strive to enhance personal hygiene and health by fostering a community-driven approach to skincare, empowering individuals on their journey to healthier, more radiant skin.

Background:
Our project focuses on developing a comprehensive skincare platform to address common skincare concerns. Skincare is a vital aspect of personal hygiene and health, yet many individuals struggle to find reliable information about skincare products and routines. Our platform aims to bridge this gap by providing users with accessible resources to make informed decisions about their skincare.
Justification:The skincare industry is vast and often overwhelming, with numerous products claiming various benefits. However, many consumers lack the knowledge to understand ingredients and their effects on the skin. Our platform seeks to empower users by offering educational content and personalized recommendations tailored to their specific skincare needs. By promoting skincare literacy and informed decision-making, we aim to enhance users' overall well-being and confidence.
Solution:Our solution involves creating an intuitive online platform where users can access information about skincare ingredients, routines, and dermatologist-recommended products. The platform will feature functionalities such as product ingredient analysis, skin type quizzes, personalized recommendations, and skincare routine management tools. Additionally, users will have access to educational resources and a directory of trusted dermatologists. Overall, our platform aims to simplify skincare routines and empower users to achieve healthier, happier skin.
