## Startup and Configuration Files

As our application is primarily a backend service built with Hapi framework and MongoDB, and does not require Docker for deployment, the following startup and configuration files are applicable:

1. **Server File**: `index.js` - This file initializes and starts the Hapi server, defines routes, and sets up the connection to MongoDB.

2. **Environment Variables File**: `.env` - This file contains environment variables such as database credentials, API keys, etc., required for the application. 

3. **Versel Configuration File**: `versel.json` - This file provides configuration options for deploying the application on the Versel platform.
